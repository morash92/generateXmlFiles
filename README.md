# generateXmlFiles
generate xml files for testing skynews radio pagination (tested with node `v8.9.4`)

1) clone this repo and run `npm i` 
2) insert an example xml file inside the ROOT which matches a skynewsradio one
2) edit the amount of files you want and the file name as an integer inside as such: generateFiles(150, 100001)
4) make sure you are in the root and run `node generate`
5) you can now upload them files to test env
